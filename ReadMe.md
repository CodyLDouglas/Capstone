Welcome to my Final Projet GitHub Repository \

The goal of this project was to use statistical modeling techniques, backed up with economic theory, to forecast wholesale beef prices. You will
see two files in this repository, a zip and a pdf. Within the zip, you will find all of the code and the data involved in this project. If downloaded,
make sure to read the ReadME for an explanation of the contents and how to execute the code. Only languages needed are R and LaTeX, a local R library 
is needed as well to check for the necessary libraries. The pdf is the final paper produced and would be the resulting paper after running the code.
If you have any other questions, please contact the author.
